## Files
1. clock_weights_stubbs.xls – Original Excel file containing CpG site coefficients from the Stubbs mouse epigenetic clock.
2. clock_weights_stubbs.csv – CSV-formatted version of the Stubbs clock CpG site weights for computational use.
3. code_sub.ipynb – Jupyter notebook implementing the methylation age prediction and statistical analysis pipeline.
4. GSE93957_exchange.tar.gz – Processed methylation .cov.gz files for GSE93957 used in epigenetic age prediction. (download from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE93957)
5. GSE120132_RAW.tar – Raw methylation data files from GSE120132 for downstream processing and analysis. (download from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE120132)
6. GSE120132-GPL17021_series_matrix.txt.gz – Series matrix file containing sample metadata (e.g., age, sex) for one platform of GSE120132.
7. GSE120132-GPL21103_series_matrix.txt.gz – Alternate platform metadata file for GSE120132, not containing some GSM entries.
8. Sample output (folder) - contains sample output

## Files (generated by code)
1. epigenetic_age_predictions.csv – Contains predicted epigenetic ages for all samples based on methylation data.
2. epigenetic_age_predictions_with_tissue.csv – Same as above but includes an additional column specifying the tissue type for each sample.
3. epigenetic_age_predictions_full.csv – Final merged dataset with predicted age, tissue type, sex, and chronological age for statistical modeling.
4. ancova_results – Directory containing output files (e.g., model summaries, ANOVA/ANCOVA results) from statistical comparisons of tissue aging patterns.

## How to run the code
1. Download GSE93957_exchange.tar.gz and GSE120132_RAW.tar
2. Put GSE93957_exchange.tar.gz and GSE120132_RAW.tar into this folder, which contains code_sub.ipynb
3. Unzip GSE93957_exchange.tar.gz and GSE120132_RAW.tar
4. Run every code block in code_sub.ipynb in order - the output folder 'ancova_results' should have the same content as the 'Sample output' folder

## Required Libraries
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. re (built-in)
4. gzip (built-in)
5. glob (built-in)
6. statsmodels
